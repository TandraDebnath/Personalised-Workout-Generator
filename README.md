# Personalised-Workout-Generator
A beginner-friendly **Python mini project** that generates a **custom workout plan** based on your **fitness goal**, **experience level**, **available workout time**, and **equipment availability**.  

This project is great for learning **conditional logic**, **data structures (dictionaries)**, and **user input handling** in Python.

## Project Overview
This script asks the user for:
- **Fitness goal** (weight loss, muscle gain, flexibility, endurance)
- **Experience level** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- **Workout time** (in minutes)
- **Equipment availability** (yes/no)

It then selects **predefined exercises** from a dictionary and adjusts them if the user does not have equipment.

## How It Works
1. **User Input** – The program takes goal, level, time, and equipment choice.
2. **Data Lookup** – It matches your goal & level with the correct list of exercises.
3. **Filtering** – If you don’t have equipment, it removes all equipment-based workouts.
4. **Output** – Prints your **personalized workout plan**.
